1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

Response: No I would not unit test this because it requires other functions to be working as well. Unit test can only test small parts of code.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

Response: Yes I would because it is a small enough function that doesn't require many of other functions to be working together.
